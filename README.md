# react-portfolio

This is my current portfolio and was created from a tutorial using React and Tailwind.

## Design and Development Decisions

I chose to use a tutorial so I could focus on the code and the content and not have to make design decisions. I chose this template because it was at my then skill level for React and I liked the layout.

I changed the color palatte and layout to suit my preferences and needs.

I added the text from an API at the bottom as a way to practice that skill in a project that was already hosted.

### Future Improvements

The tailwind css is not working well for me. I plan to change it over to bootstrap.

Project currently uses an API to display a string of Greeked text. I'd like to change that to an animal image.

I'd also like to improve the text and add a picture of myself.
