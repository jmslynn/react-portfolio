# react-portfolio

This is my current portfolio.

It is hosted here: https://quizzical-bose-4f333b.netlify.app/

## Design and Development Decisions

I chose to start with a tutorial so I could focus on the code and the content and not have to make design decisions. I chose this template because it was at my then skill level for React and I liked the layout.

I changed the color palatte, layout, and a few design elements to suit my preferences and needs.

I added the text from an API at the bottom as a way to practice that skill in a project that was already hosted.

### Future Improvements

Further refine project skills to pull from an array instead of a preset number of skills

Project currently uses an API to display a string of Greeked text. I'd like to change that to an animal image.

I'd also like to improve the text and add a picture of myself.
