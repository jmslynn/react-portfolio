# react-portfolio

This is my current portfolio and was created from a tutorial using React and Tailwind.

It is hosted here: https://quizzical-bose-4f333b.netlify.app/

## Design and Development Decisions

I chose to use a tutorial so I could focus on the code and the content and not have to make design decisions. I chose this template because it was at my then skill level for React and I liked the layout.

I changed the color palatte and layout to suit my preferences and needs.

I added the text from an API at the bottom as a way to practice that skill in a project that was already hosted.

### Future Improvements

The tailwind css is not working well for me. I plan to change it over to bootstrap. This will hopefully fix the small screen layout issues and the text overlay display in the Portfolio section.

Project currently uses an API to display a string of Greeked text. I'd like to change that to an animal image.

I'd also like to improve the text and add a picture of myself.
